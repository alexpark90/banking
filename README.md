# banking
This was my second java assignment.

This program is simple console based program.
It allows a user to select to create an either checking or saving account and following actions to take.
Checking account will be created with initial deposit and overdraft.
Saving account will be created with initial deposit and interest rate.
There are some restrictions, for example, initial deposit should be > 0.
It also checks if user entered valid numeric value or not and if there is an error, show the error message to the user.
