# banking
This was my second java assignment.<br /><br />

This program is simple console based program.<br />
It allows a user to select to create an either checking or saving account and following actions to take.<br />
Checking account will be created with initial deposit and overdraft.<br />
Saving account will be created with initial deposit and interest rate.<br />
There are some restrictions, for example, initial deposit should be > 0.<br />
It also checks if user entered valid numeric value or not and if there is an error, show the error message to the user.<br />
<br />
All possible Exception is handled propery.
